Linux command line word vending application in C.
Make sure som.c, sQue.h, and input.txt are all in the same directory.
Compile from linux command line (ex. gcc som.c).
Run the a.out followed by a txt file (ex. ./a.out input.txt).
I have included an input.txt file, but feel free to make your own.
There are also some breif instructions in the comments at the top of the som.c file.
